# clj-htmx

Backend helpers for [htmx](https://htmx.org/).

## Rationale

[htmx](https://htmx.org/) enables web developers to create powerful webapps without writing any javascript.  Whenever `hx-*` attributes are included on the webpage the library will update the dom in response to user events.  The architecture is simpler and pages load more quickly than in javascript oriented webapps.

clj-htmx is a backend accompaniment which makes htmx even easier to use.  It works in conjunction with [hiccup](https://weavejester.github.io/hiccup/) for rendering and [reitit](https://cljdoc.org/d/metosin/reitit/0.5.10/doc/introduction) for routing.

## Demo

Clone and run [clj-htmx-demo](https://github.com/whamtet/clj-htmx-demo).

## Usage

First require the library

```clojure
(require '[clj-htmx.core :refer :all])
```

The core of clj-htmx is the `defendpoint` macro.

```clojure
(defendpoint hello [req my-name]
  [:div#hello "Hello " my-name])
```

This defines an ordinary function which also expands to an endpoint `/hello`.

To use our endpoint we call `make-routes`

```clojure
(make-routes
  "/demo"
  (fn [req]
    (render/html5-response
      [:div {:style "padding: 10px"}
        [:label {:style "margin-right: 10px"}
          "What is your name?"]
        [:input {:type "text"
                 :name "my-name"
                 :hx-patch "hello"
                 :hx-target "#hello"
                 :hx-swap "outerHTML"}]
         (hello req "")])))
```

Here the only active element is the text input.  On the input's default action (blur) it will request to `/hello` and replace `#hello` with the server response.  We are using `hello` both as a function and an endpoint.  When called as an endpoint arguments are set based on the html `name` attribute.

**The first argument to defendpoint is always the req object**

### Responses

If `defendpoint` returns `nil` it will be wrapped in **204 - No Content** and htmx will not update the dom.

### Casting

Because htmx submits parameters as strings it can be convenient to cast `defendpoint` arguments e.g.

```clojure
(defendpoint my-endpoint [req ^:int integer-argument ^:boolean boolean-argument])
```

Supported casts include

* `^:int` Integer
* `^:lower` Lower-case string
* `^:trim` Trimmed string
* `^:boolean` True when argument = "true" or "on" (for checkboxes).

### defcomponent

Nested calls to `defendpoint` must also be `defendpoint` to macroexpand correctly.  If you do not wish to expose intermediate functions as endpoints use `defcomponent` instead.
